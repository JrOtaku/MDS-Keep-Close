# MDS-Keep-Close
Repository for Keep Close project files
This application supports to hardware for the Keep Close device.
Java was used over Kotlin since there are better resources for connecting to bluetooth with Java
The bluetooth connections was no able to be implemented, and there are still bugs on the functionality to change pages. 

Table of Contents
The MainActivity class creates the starting page for the app, and should include two buttons to change pages
The DeviceSetUpPage class should contain the functionality to connect with bluetooth and return to the MainActivity Page.
The SettingsPage should include buttons to customize the settings, and submit button to send that information to the Keep Close Device. There should also be a button to return to the home page.

This project was created by Emily Guajardo as a part of her Senior Design Project.
